# For AP Computer Science Principle Test
- I'm not even sure why I took the class and it taught me nothing, like a drip of water in an ocean
- I used the Dice Roller App for my Create Task and got full marks in class and probally on the AP Test Aswell
- Someother were renditions of ideas I had for this, these were all made in around 10 minutes, but the otherones are a little too complicated for the college board I believe
